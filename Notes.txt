L0 backups at least yearly
L1 backups at least monthly
L2 backups weekly

purge L0 backups after 1 year
purge L1 backups after 3 months
purge L2 backups after 1 month

currently snar files are getting overwritten so only the most recent backup is recoverable. Is this okay? It means for any given source directory, there is only one recoverable L0, L1 and L2 backup set.

Solution: add a snar set ID to the


when creating a new backup, purge all backups for that target and level that are older than the purge period for that level. Given the decreasing retention period as level goes up, no higher level backup should ever exist when its lower level dependency has been purged.



Process:
prepBackupDirs.sh - reads AutoBackup.cfg and creates a target directory structure to hold all the backups.
doBackup.sh
	find all tar files in target directory
	looping over all lines in AutoBackup.cfg
		walk the tar file list to find the latest date for each level of backup
		find the corresponding file size
		Calculate the appropriate backup level based on file sizes
		Do a purge for this level
		incBackup.sh src tgt level
			figure out appropriate SNAR level
			copy snar file to new snar file for backup level if necessary
			mpTarHelper.sh
